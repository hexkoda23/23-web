Sustainable Fashion Data:
The fashion industry produces 10% of all humanity's carbon emissions.
Sustainable fashion focuses on reducing this impact through eco-friendly materials and ethical labor.
"Slow Fashion" is the movement of designing, creating, and buying garments for quality and longevity.
23 Look uses 100% organic cotton and recycled polyester in its collections.
We have zero-plastic packaging policy.
Recycling clothes reduces landfill waste.
Buying second-hand or vintage is one of the most sustainable fashion choices.
Quality over quantity: It is better to buy one expensive, high-quality shirt that lasts years than 5 cheap ones that last months.
