Clothing Care Guide:
Cotton: Machine wash cold (30°C) with like colors. Tumble dry low or air dry to prevent shrinkage.
Wool: Hand wash or dry clean only. Never tumble dry. Lay flat to dry to maintain shape.
Leather: Do not wash. Wipe clean with a damp cloth. Use a specialist leather conditioner every 6 months.
Denim: Wash as infrequently as possible to preserve color and fit. Turn inside out before washing. Air dry.
Silk: Dry clean is recommended. If hand washing, use special silk detergent and cold water.
Storage: Store knits folded (hanging causes stretching). Use padded hangers for jackets.
Stain Removal: Treat stains immediately. Blot, don't rub.
